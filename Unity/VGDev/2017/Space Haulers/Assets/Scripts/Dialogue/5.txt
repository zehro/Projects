I have a series of bad news.
1. Our warp engine was damaged.
2. We seem to have dropped out of warp into a war zone.
3. Lastly, there’s a black hole.
……..
Oh!
I can use some of this cargo to fix the engine!
But I’ll need to use almost all of it in the process…
Just make it to the other side of the black hole and avoid getting sucked in
or shot….
Good luck!
