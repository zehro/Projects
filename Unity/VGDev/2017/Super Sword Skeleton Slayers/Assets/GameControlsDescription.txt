If you're confused about the controls, here you go:
Arrow keys: Move, navigate through menus
D: Confirm
S: Back

Unfinished:
Enter: Open menu
W: TBD
A: TBD

The reason WASD are used as buttons is to mimic a standard D-pad, four-button layout. D corresponds to a SNES controller's A button, S corresponds to B, etc.

Debug:
O: Start random battle ([O]pen battle window)
Numpad 1, 2: add additional Knight to party. As more hero classes are created, each numpad key will correspond to a different class.
