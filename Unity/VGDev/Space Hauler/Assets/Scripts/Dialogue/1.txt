Here’s a pretty good route.
Same as usual, just make it to the other side.
One thing to note before we go:
other ships use this route regularly and some seem to drop
a few crates here and there.
Luckily for us, we’re equipped to “acquire” this loose cargo.
So, go nuts and pick up what you can.
You need the money.
